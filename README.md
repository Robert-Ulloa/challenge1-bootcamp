# challenge1-bootcamp

## Description
In this project, I focused on enhancing the semantics of the HTML and CSS to improve the overall structure for a better design and maintain a cleaner CSS stylesheet. Additionally, I ensured that all images have proper alt attributes for accessibility purposes. Despite these modifications, the website continues to function as expected.

## Changes Made
- Improved HTML and CSS semantics for better structure and design.
- Added alt attributes to all images for accessibility.
- Ensured website functionality remains unaffected by the changes.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
